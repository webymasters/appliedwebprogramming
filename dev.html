            <p>
               I am <strong>Manpreet Singh </strong> from <em>India</em> having lots of interests in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web"> web technologies</a>.I have been involved in many projects based on PHP in past years though mostly had been washed from my mind due to decent gap in this field.
         
            </p>
            
            <p>
               My main <strong>aim</strong>  from this course is to refresh my knowledge, polish it with latest available tools and technologies and set my career in this web field as I just love knowing things about websites that how they are made or what logics have been used to build any interesting web page.

            <h2 class="highlight txtcenter">Suggestion</h2>   
            <p>
               I feel students should get oppurtunity to work on college live projects.That can be very effective for student's skill development as well as their profile.
